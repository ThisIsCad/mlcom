Since the Halle Party Congress has put the discussion of the Gotha Programme on the agenda of the Party, I think I would be guilty of suppression if I any longer withheld from publicity this important &ndash; perhaps the most important &ndash; document relevant to this discussion.</p><p>But the manuscript has yet another and more far-reaching significance. Here for the first time Marx&rsquo;s attitude to the line adopted by Lassalle in his agitation from the very beginning is clearly and firmly set forth, both as regards Lassalle&rsquo;s economic principles and his tactics.</p><p>The ruthless severity with which the draft programme is dissected here, the mercilessness with which the results obtained are enunciated and the shortcomings of the draft laid bare &ndash; all this today, after fifteen years, can no longer give offence. Specific Lassalleans now exist only abroad as isolated ruins, and in Halle the Gotha Programme was given up even by its creators as altogether inadequate.</p><p>Nevertheless, I have omitted a few sharp personal expressions and judgments where these were immaterial, and replaced them by dots. Marx himself would have done so if he had published the manuscript today. The violence of the language in some passages was provoked by two circumstances. In the first place, Marx and I had been more intimately connected with the German movement than with any other; we were, therefore, bound to be particularly perturbed by the decidedly retrograde step manifested by this draft programme. And secondly, we were at that time, hardly two years after the Hague Congress of the International, engaged in the most violent struggle against Bakunin and his anarchists, who made us responsible for everything that happened in the labour movement in Germany; hence we had to expect that we would also be addled with the secret paternity of this programme. These considerations do not now exist and so there is no necessity for the passages in question.</p><p>For reasons arising form the Press Law, also, a few sentences have been indicated only by dots. Where I have had to choose a milder expression this has been enclosed in square brackets. Otherwise the text has been reproduced word for word.</p><p><span class=signature><em>London, January 6, 1891</em></span></p><hr><h2 id=footnotes>Footnotes</h2><div class=footnotes><p><a href=#ref1 name=note1>[1]</a> Before the Critique of the Gotha Programme was written, Engels wrote a letter to August Bebel expressing Marx and Engels&rsquo; surprise at the programme, and going on to criticise it.</p></div></article></div></section><section id=sidebar><div class=author-biopic><img alt="Karl Marx" src=/images/author_karl_marx_hu34e936d5d37a4a4d54a56ff89fd422a9_282840_200x200_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg></div><h2 id=author-name>Karl Marx</h2><p id=author-details>Karl Marx was a German philosopher, economist, sociologist, historian, journalist, and revolutionary socialist.
He was born in Trier, Prussia (now Germany), in 1818 and died in London, England, in 1883.<br><br>He was best known for his contributions to the theory of communism, which he developed with Friedrich Engels.
He believed that capitalism, which is based on the exploitation of the working class, would inevitably lead to
its own downfall and be replaced by socialism, a classless society in which the means of production would be
owned and controlled by the community as a whole.<br><br>Marx's ideas have had a significant influence on political thought and the development of socialist and
communist movements worldwide.</p><p id=original-attributions>This document was originally copied from the <a href=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/>Marxist Internet Archive</a>.</p><p><a href=https://github.com/ThisIsCad/mlcom/blob/master/content/archives/marx/1875-gotha-critique/foreword.md>Contribute To This Page<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" width="12" height="12" viewBox="0 0 32 32" class="fill-current v-base" aria-label="External Link"><path d="M25.152 16.576v5.696q0 2.144-1.504 3.648T20 27.424H5.152q-2.144.0-3.648-1.504T0 22.272V7.424q0-2.112 1.504-3.616t3.648-1.536h12.576q.224.0.384.16t.16.416V4q0 .256-.16.416t-.384.16H5.152q-1.184.0-2.016.832t-.864 2.016v14.848q0 1.184.864 2.016t2.016.864H20q1.184.0 2.016-.864t.832-2.016v-5.696q0-.256.16-.416t.416-.16h1.152q.256.0.416.16t.16.416zM32 1.152v9.12q0 .48-.352.8t-.8.352-.8-.352l-3.136-3.136-11.648 11.648q-.16.192-.416.192t-.384-.192l-2.048-2.048q-.192-.16-.192-.384t.192-.416L24.064 5.088l-3.136-3.136q-.352-.352-.352-.8t.352-.8.8-.352h9.12q.48.0.8.352t.352.8z"/></svg></a></p></section></main><footer class=footer><div class="center mw9 flex-ns flex-wrap items-center justify-start"><p>This is a community maintained and operated website for Marxist-Leninists.</p></div></footer><script>var main_menu=document.getElementById("main-menu"),activeFootnote,main_menu_visible=!1;document.getElementById("hamburger-menu").addEventListener("click",e=>{e.preventDefault(),main_menu_visible?(main_menu_visible=!1,main_menu.classList=["collapsed"]):(main_menu_visible=!0,main_menu.classList=["visible"])}),document.getElementById("switch-style").addEventListener("change",e=>{e.target.checked?(document.getElementsByTagName("html")[0].classList.add("night"),document.cookie="colorMode=night; expires=Sun, 30 Dec 2029 12:00:00 UTC; path=/"):(document.getElementsByTagName("html")[0].classList.remove("night"),document.cookie="colorMode=light; expires=Sun, 30 Dec 2029 12:00:00 UTC; path=/")}),(document.cookie||"").includes("colorMode=night")&&(document.getElementById("switch-style").checked=!0,document.getElementsByTagName("html")[0].classList.add("night")),activeFootnote=null,window.onhashchange=function(){if(activeFootnote&&activeFootnote.classList.remove("highlight"),location.hash){var t=location.hash.substring(1);t.substring(0,4)==="note"&&(activeFootnote=document.querySelector('a[name="'+t+'"]').parentElement,activeFootnote&&activeFootnote.classList.add("highlight"))}},window.onhashchange(),document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){let e=document.querySelector(".loading");e.classList.remove("loading")})</script></body></html>
