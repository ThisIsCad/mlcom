The full letter is available from our archives.</div><br><br><p>I must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro&rsquo;s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen&rsquo;s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to &ldquo;order&rdquo; than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: &ldquo;I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action&rdquo;; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man&rsquo;s freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a &ldquo;more convenient season.&rdquo; Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.</p><p>I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress. I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace, in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive and positive peace, in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality. Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with. Like a boil that can never be cured so long as it is covered up but must be opened with all its ugliness to the natural medicines of air and light, injustice must be exposed, with all the tension its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and the air of national opinion before it can be cured.</p><p>In your statement you assert that our actions, even though peaceful, must be condemned because they precipitate violence. But is this a logical assertion? Isn&rsquo;t this like condemning a robbed man because his possession of money precipitated the evil act of robbery? Isn&rsquo;t this like condemning Socrates because his unswerving commitment to truth and his philosophical inquiries precipitated the act by the misguided populace in which they made him drink hemlock? Isn&rsquo;t this like condemning Jesus because his unique God consciousness and never ceasing devotion to God&rsquo;s will precipitated the evil act of crucifixion? We must come to see that, as the federal courts have consistently affirmed, it is wrong to urge an individual to cease his efforts to gain his basic constitutional rights because the quest may precipitate violence. Society must protect the robbed and punish the robber. I had also hoped that the white moderate would reject the myth concerning time in relation to the struggle for freedom. I have just received a letter from a white brother in Texas. He writes: &ldquo;All Christians know that the colored people will receive equal rights eventually, but it is possible that you are in too great a religious hurry. It has taken Christianity almost two thousand years to accomplish what it has. The teachings of Christ take time to come to earth.&rdquo; Such an attitude stems from a tragic misconception of time, from the strangely irrational notion that there is something in the very flow of time that will inevitably cure all ills. Actually, time itself is neutral; it can be used either destructively or constructively. More and more I feel that the people of ill will have used time much more effectively than have the people of good will. We will have to repent in this generation not merely for the hateful words and actions of the bad people but for the appalling silence of the good people. Human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to be co workers with God, and without this hard work, time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation. We must use time creatively, in the knowledge that the time is always ripe to do right. Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood. Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity.</p><p>You speak of our activity in Birmingham as extreme. At first I was rather disappointed that fellow clergymen would see my nonviolent efforts as those of an extremist. I began thinking about the fact that I stand in the middle of two opposing forces in the Negro community. One is a force of complacency, made up in part of Negroes who, as a result of long years of oppression, are so drained of self respect and a sense of &ldquo;somebodiness&rdquo; that they have adjusted to segregation; and in part of a few middle-class Negroes who, because of a degree of academic and economic security and because in some ways they profit by segregation, have become insensitive to the problems of the masses. The other force is one of bitterness and hatred, and it comes perilously close to advocating violence. It is expressed in the various black nationalist groups that are springing up across the nation, the largest and best known being Elijah Muhammad&rsquo;s Muslim movement. Nourished by the Negro&rsquo;s frustration over the continued existence of racial discrimination, this movement is made up of people who have lost faith in America, who have absolutely repudiated Christianity, and who have concluded that the white man is an incorrigible &ldquo;devil.&rdquo;</p><p>I have tried to stand between these two forces, saying that we need emulate neither the &ldquo;do nothingism&rdquo; of the complacent nor the hatred and despair of the black nationalist. For there is the more excellent way of love and nonviolent protest. I am grateful to God that, through the influence of the Negro church, the way of nonviolence became an integral part of our struggle. If this philosophy had not emerged, by now many streets of the South would, I am convinced, be flowing with blood. And I am further convinced that if our white brothers dismiss as &ldquo;rabble rousers&rdquo; and &ldquo;outside agitators&rdquo; those of us who employ nonviolent direct action, and if they refuse to support our nonviolent efforts, millions of Negroes will, out of frustration and despair, seek solace and security in black nationalist ideologies&ndash;a development that would inevitably lead to a frightening racial nightmare.</p><p>Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever. The yearning for freedom eventually manifests itself, and that is what has happened to the American Negro. Something within has reminded him of his birthright of freedom, and something without has reminded him that it can be gained. Consciously or unconsciously, he has been caught up by the Zeitgeist, and with his black brothers of Africa and his brown and yellow brothers of Asia, South America and the Caribbean, the United States Negro is moving with a sense of great urgency toward the promised land of racial justice. If one recognizes this vital urge that has engulfed the Negro community, one should readily understand why public demonstrations are taking place. The Negro has many pent up resentments and latent frustrations, and he must release them. So let him march; let him make prayer pilgrimages to the city hall; let him go on freedom rides -and try to understand why he must do so. If his repressed emotions are not released in nonviolent ways, they will seek expression through violence; this is not a threat but a fact of history. So I have not said to my people: &ldquo;Get rid of your discontent.&rdquo; Rather, I have tried to say that this normal and healthy discontent can be channeled into the creative outlet of nonviolent direct action. And now this approach is being termed extremist. But though I was initially disappointed at being categorized as an extremist, as I continued to think about the matter I gradually gained a measure of satisfaction from the label. Was not Jesus an extremist for love: &ldquo;Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.&rdquo; Was not Amos an extremist for justice: &ldquo;Let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever flowing stream.&rdquo; Was not Paul an extremist for the Christian gospel: &ldquo;I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.&rdquo; Was not Martin Luther an extremist: &ldquo;Here I stand; I cannot do otherwise, so help me God.&rdquo; And John Bunyan: &ldquo;I will stay in jail to the end of my days before I make a butchery of my conscience.&rdquo; And Abraham Lincoln: &ldquo;This nation cannot survive half slave and half free.&rdquo; And Thomas Jefferson: &ldquo;We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal . . .&rdquo; So the question is not whether we will be extremists, but what kind of extremists we will be. Will we be extremists for hate or for love? Will we be extremists for the preservation of injustice or for the extension of justice? In that dramatic scene on Calvary&rsquo;s hill three men were crucified. We must never forget that all three were crucified for the same crime&ndash;the crime of extremism. Two were extremists for immorality, and thus fell below their environment. The other, Jesus Christ, was an extremist for love, truth and goodness, and thereby rose above his environment. Perhaps the South, the nation and the world are in dire need of creative extremists.</p><p>I had hoped that the white moderate would see this need. Perhaps I was too optimistic; perhaps I expected too much. I suppose I should have realized that few members of the oppressor race can understand the deep groans and passionate yearnings of the oppressed race, and still fewer have the vision to see that injustice must be rooted out by strong, persistent and determined action. I am thankful, however, that some of our white brothers in the South have grasped the meaning of this social revolution and committed themselves to it. They are still all too few in quantity, but they are big in quality. Some -such as Ralph McGill, Lillian Smith, Harry Golden, James McBride Dabbs, Ann Braden and Sarah Patton Boyle&ndash;have written about our struggle in eloquent and prophetic terms. Others have marched with us down nameless streets of the South. They have languished in filthy, roach infested jails, suffering the abuse and brutality of policemen who view them as &ldquo;dirty nigger-lovers.&rdquo; Unlike so many of their moderate brothers and sisters, they have recognized the urgency of the moment and sensed the need for powerful &ldquo;action&rdquo; antidotes to combat the disease of segregation. Let me take note of my other major disappointment. I have been so greatly disappointed with the white church and its leadership. Of course, there are some notable exceptions. I am not unmindful of the fact that each of you has taken some significant stands on this issue. I commend you, Reverend Stallings, for your Christian stand on this past Sunday, in welcoming Negroes to your worship service on a nonsegregated basis. I commend the Catholic leaders of this state for integrating Spring Hill College several years ago.</p></article></div></section><section id=sidebar><div class=author-biopic><img alt="Martin Luther King Jr." src=/images/author_mlkjr_huee9ba290d0fcc9f26b907026d20fc6ed_200081_200x200_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg></div><h2 id=author-name>Martin Luther King Jr.</h2><p id=author-details>Martin Luther King Jr. was an American Baptist minister and activist, one of the most prominent leaders in the civil rights movement from 1955 until his assassination in 1968.</p><p id=original-attributions>This document was originally copied from the the <a href=https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html>University of Pennsylvania</a>.</p><p><a href=https://github.com/ThisIsCad/mlcom/blob/master/content/archives/mlk/white-moderates.md>Contribute To This Page<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" width="12" height="12" viewBox="0 0 32 32" class="fill-current v-base" aria-label="External Link"><path d="M25.152 16.576v5.696q0 2.144-1.504 3.648T20 27.424H5.152q-2.144.0-3.648-1.504T0 22.272V7.424q0-2.112 1.504-3.616t3.648-1.536h12.576q.224.0.384.16t.16.416V4q0 .256-.16.416t-.384.16H5.152q-1.184.0-2.016.832t-.864 2.016v14.848q0 1.184.864 2.016t2.016.864H20q1.184.0 2.016-.864t.832-2.016v-5.696q0-.256.16-.416t.416-.16h1.152q.256.0.416.16t.16.416zM32 1.152v9.12q0 .48-.352.8t-.8.352-.8-.352l-3.136-3.136-11.648 11.648q-.16.192-.416.192t-.384-.192l-2.048-2.048q-.192-.16-.192-.384t.192-.416L24.064 5.088l-3.136-3.136q-.352-.352-.352-.8t.352-.8.8-.352h9.12q.48.0.8.352t.352.8z"/></svg></a></p></section></main><footer class=footer><div class="center mw9 flex-ns flex-wrap items-center justify-start"><p>This is a community maintained and operated website for Marxist-Leninists.</p></div></footer><script>var main_menu=document.getElementById("main-menu"),activeFootnote,main_menu_visible=!1;document.getElementById("hamburger-menu").addEventListener("click",e=>{e.preventDefault(),main_menu_visible?(main_menu_visible=!1,main_menu.classList=["collapsed"]):(main_menu_visible=!0,main_menu.classList=["visible"])}),document.getElementById("switch-style").addEventListener("change",e=>{e.target.checked?(document.getElementsByTagName("html")[0].classList.add("night"),document.cookie="colorMode=night; expires=Sun, 30 Dec 2029 12:00:00 UTC; path=/"):(document.getElementsByTagName("html")[0].classList.remove("night"),document.cookie="colorMode=light; expires=Sun, 30 Dec 2029 12:00:00 UTC; path=/")}),(document.cookie||"").includes("colorMode=night")&&(document.getElementById("switch-style").checked=!0,document.getElementsByTagName("html")[0].classList.add("night")),activeFootnote=null,window.onhashchange=function(){if(activeFootnote&&activeFootnote.classList.remove("highlight"),location.hash){var t=location.hash.substring(1);t.substring(0,4)==="note"&&(activeFootnote=document.querySelector('a[name="'+t+'"]').parentElement,activeFootnote&&activeFootnote.classList.add("highlight"))}},window.onhashchange(),document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){let e=document.querySelector(".loading");e.classList.remove("loading")})</script></body></html>
