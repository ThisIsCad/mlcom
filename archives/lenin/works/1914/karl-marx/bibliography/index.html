yet been published. More works by Marx have been translated into
Russian than into any other language. The following list of
Marx&#8217;s writings is arranged in chronological order. In 1841 Marx wrote
his thesis on Epicurus&#8217;s philosophy. (It was included in
<em>Literarischer Nachiass</em>, of which more will be said later.) In this
thesis, Marx still fully adhered to the Hegelian idealist point of view. In
1842 Marx wrote articles for <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> (Cologne), among
them a criticism of the free-press debate in the Sixth Rhenish Diet, an
article on the laws concerning the stealing of timber, another in defence of
divorcing politics from theology, etc. (partly included in <em>Literarischer
Nachiass</em>). Here we see signs of Marx&#8217;s transition from idealism
to materialism and from revolutionary democracy to communism. In 1844, under
the editorship of Marx and Arnold Ruge, there appeared in Paris
<em>Deutsche-Franzosische Jahrb&#252;cher</em>, in which this transition
was finally made. Among Marx&#8217;s articles published in that magazine,
the most noteworthy are <em>A Criticism of the Hegelian Philosophy of
Right</em> (besides <em>Literarischer Nachiass</em>, also published as a
separate pamphlet) and <em>On the Jewish Question</em> (likewise in
<em>Literarischer Nachiass;</em> issued as a pamphlet brought out by the
<em>Znaniye</em> Publishers in their Cheap Library, No. 210). In 1845, Marx
and Engels jointly published, in Frankfort on Main, a pamphlet entitled
<em>The Holy Family. Against Bruno Bauer and Co.</em> (besides
<em>Literarischer Nachiass</em>, there are two Russian editions as
pamphlets: one published by <em>Novy Gobs</em> in St. Petersburg, 1906, the
other by <em>Vesinik Znaniya</em>, St. Petersburg, 1907). In the spring of
1845, Marx wrote his theses on Feuerbach (published as an appendix to
Frederick Engels&#8217;s pamphlet entitled <em>Ludwig Feuerbach</em> (there
is a Russian translation). In 1845-47 Marx wrote a number of articles (most
of which have not been collected, republished, or translated into Russian)
in the papers <em>Vorw&#228;rts, Deutsche Br&#228;sseler-Zeitung</em>
(1847); <em>Westphalisches Dampboot</em> (Bide. fold, 1845-48); <em>Der
Gesellschatsspiegel</em> (Elberfeld, 1846). In 1847 Marx wrote his
fundamental work against Proudhon, <em>The Poverty of Philosophy</em>, a
reply to Proudhon&#8217;s work <em>The Philosophy of Poverty</em>. The book
was published in Brussels and Paris (there have been three publications in
Russian by <em>Novy Mir</em>, one by G. Lvovich, one by Alexeyeva, and one
by <em>Prosveshcheniye</em>, all in 1905-06). In 1848 the <em>Speech on Free
Trade</em> was published in Brussels (Russian translation available),
followed by the publication in London, in collaboration with Frederick
Engels, of the celebrated <em>Manifesto of the Communist Party</em>, which has been
translated into probably all the languages of Europe and into a number of
other languages (there are about eight Russian publications referring to
1905 and 1906; by <em>Molot, Kolokol, Alexeyeva, etc.</em>, most of which were
confiscated. These appeared under various titles: <em>The Communist
Manifesto, On Communism, Social Classes and Communism, Capitalism and
Communism, The Philosophy of History</em>. A complete and most accurate
translation of this, as well as of other works by Marx, will be found in the
editions of the Emancipation of Labour group, issued
abroad<sup class=ednote><a name=bkV21E039 href=#fwV21E039>[31]</a></sup>). From
June 1, 1848, to May 19, 1849, <em>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</em> was
published in Cologne with Marx as the actual editor-in-chief. His numerous
articles for that paper, which to this very day remains the finest and
unsurpassed organ of the revolutionary proletariat, have not been collected
and republished in full. The most important of them were included in
<em>Literarischer Nachiass</em>. <em>Wage-Labour and Capital</em>, published in that
paper, has been repeatedly issued as a pamphlet (four Russian editions, by
Kozman, <em>Mobot</em>, Myagkov, and Lvovich, 1905 and 1906); also from the
same paper <em>The Liberals at the Helm</em> (published by Znaniye
Publishers in their Cheap Library, No. 272, St. Petersburg, 1901). In 1849
Marx published, in Cologne, <em>Two Political Trials</em> (two speeches in
his own defence by Marx, who was acquitted by a jury when facing trial on
the charge of having violated the press law and called for armed resistance
to the government. Russian translations are available in five publications
brought out in 1905 and 1906 by Alexayeva, Molot, Myagkov, <em>Znaniye</em>,
and <em>Novy Mir</em>). In 1850 Marx published, in Hamburg, six issues of
the magazine <em>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</em>. The most important articles published
therein were later included in <em>Literarischer Nachiass</em>. Especially
noteworthy are Marx&#8217;s articles, republished by Engels in 1895 in a
pamphlet entitled <em>Class Struggles in France, 1848-1850</em> (Russian
translation, published by M. Malykh, Library, No. 59-60; also in the
<em>Collection of Historical Works</em>, translated by Bazarov and
Stepanov and published by Skirmunt, St. Petersburg, 1906; also <em>Thoughts
and Views of the 20th Century</em>, St. Petersburg, 1912). In 1852 a
pamphlet by Marx was published in New York under the title of <em>The
Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte</em> (Russian translation in
publications just mentioned). In the same year a pamphlet was published in
London under the title of <em>Enth&#252;llungen fiber den Communistenprozess in
K&#246;ln</em> (Russian translation entitled <em>The Cologne Trial of the
Communards</em>, Popular Science Library, No. 43, St. Petersburg, 1906,
Oct. 28).</p><p>From August 1851 until 1862,<sup class=ednote><a name=bkV21P082F01 href=#fwV21P082F01>[1]</a></sup>
Marx was a regular contributor
to the <em>New York Tribune</em>, where many of his articles appeared
unsigned, as editorials. Most outstanding among these is a series of
articles, <em>Revolution and Counter-Revolution in Germany</em>, which were
republished after the death of Marx and Engels in a German translation (a
Russian translation is available in collections translated by Bazarov and
Stepanov, and then, in pamphlet form, in five editions brought out in
1905-06 by Alexeyeva, Obshchestvennaya Poiza, Novy Mir, Vseobshchaya
Biblioteka and <em>Molot</em>). Some of Marx&#8217;s articles in the
<em>Tribune</em> were later published in London as separate pamphlets, as,
for instance, the one on Palmerston, published in 1856; <em>Revelations of
the Diplomatic History of the 18th Century</em> (regarding the constant
venal dependence on Russia of the British Liberal Ministers), and
others. After Marx&#8217;s death, his daughter, Eleanor Aveling, published a
number of his <em>Tribune</em> articles on the Oriental question, under the
title of <em>The Eastern Question</em>, London, 1897. Part has been
translated into Russian: <em>War and Revolution</em>, Issue I, Marx and
Engels: <em>Unpublished Articles (1852, 1853, 1854)</em>, Kharkov, 1919
(<em>Our Thought</em> Library). From the end of 1854, and during 1855, Marx
contributed to the <em>Neue Oder-Zeitung</em> and in 1861-62 to the Viennese
paper <em>Presse</em>. These articles have not been collected, and only a few of
them were reprinted in <em>Die Neue Zeit</em>, as were also Marx&#8217;s
numerous letters. The same is true about Marx&#8217;s articles from <em>Das
Volk</em> (London, 1859) on the diplomatic history of the Italian War of
1859. In 1859 Marx&#8217;s <em>Contribution to the Critique of Political
Economy</em> appeared in Berlin (Russian translations: Moscow, 1896, edited
by Manuilov; St. Petersburg, 1907, translated by Rumyantsev), In 1860 a
pamphlet by Marx, entitled <em>Herr Vogt</em>, appeared in London.</p><p>In 1864 the <em>Address of the International Workingmen&#8217;s
Association</em>, which was written by Marx, came out in London (Russian
translation available). Marx was the author of numerous manifestos, appeals
and resolutions of the International&#8217;s General Council. This material
is far from having been analysed or even collected. The first approach to
this work is Gustav Jaeckh&#8217;s book, <em>Die Internationale</em> (in the
Russian translation: St. Petersburg, 1906, Znaniye Publishers), which
includes several of Marx&#8217;s letters and draft resolutions. Among the
documents of the International that Marx wrote was the <em>Address of the
General Council on the Paris Commune</em>. The document appeared in 1871
in London, as a pamphlet entitled <em>The Civil War in France</em>
(Russian translations: one edited by Lenin, Molot Publishers, and
others). Between 1862 and 1874 Marx corresponded with Kugelniann, a member
of the International (two Russian translations: one by A. Goikhbarg, the
other edited by Lenin). In 1867 Marx&#8217;s main work, <em>Capital: A
Critique of Political Economy</em>, Vol. 1, appeared in Hamburg. Volumes 2
and 3 were published by Engels in 1885 and 1894, after the death of
Marx. The Russian translations: Vol. 1, in five editions (two in a
translation by Danielson, 1872 and 1898; two in a translation by
E. A. Gurvich and L. M. Zak, edited
by Struve; 1st ed.&#8212;1899, 2nd ed.&#8212;1905; another edited by Bazarov and
Stepauov). Volumes 2 and 3 appeared in a translation by Danielson (less
satisfactory) and in another under the editorship of Bazarov and Stepanov
(the better). In 1876 Marx took part in the writing of Engels&#8217;s
<em>Herrn Eugen D&#252;hrings Umw&#228;lzung der Wissenschaft
(Anti-D&#252;hring)</em>; he went over the manuscript of the whole work
and wrote an entire chapter dealing with the history of political economy.</p><p>The following works by Marx were published posthumously: <em>Critique of
the Gotha Programme</em> (St. Petersburg, 1906, and in German in <em>Die
Neue Zeit</em>, 1890-91, No, 18); <em>Value, Price and Profit</em> (a
lecture delivered on June 26, 1865; <em>Die Neue Zeit</em>, XVI, 1897-98; Russian
translations, brought out by <em>Molot</em>, 1906, and Lvovich, 1905); <em>Aus
dem literarischen Nachiass von Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels und
Ferdinand Lassalle</em>, three volumes, Stuttgart, 1902 (Russian
translation, edited by Axelrod and others, 2 vols., St. Petersburg, 1908:
Vol. 1 also edited by E. Gurvich, Moscow, 1907. Lassalle&#8217;s letters
to Marx, published separately, are included in <em>Literarischer
Nachiass); Letters from K. Marx and F. Engels and Others to F. A. Sorge
and Others</em> (two editions in Russian; one edited by Axeirod, another
published by Dauge, with a preface by Lenin); <em>Theorien fiber den
Mehrwert</em>, three volumes in four parts, Stuttgart, 1905-10, which is
the manuscript of the fourth volume of <em>Capital</em> and published by
Kautsky (only the first volume translated into Russian; in three editions;
St. Petersburg, 1906, edited by Plekhanov; Kiev, 1906, edited by
Zheleznov, and Kiev, 1907, edited by Tuchapsky). In 1913 four big volumes
of <em>Marx-Engels Correspondence</em> came out in Stuttgart, with 1,386
letters written between September 1844 and January 10, 1883, and providing
a mass of highly valuable material for a study of Marx&#8217;s biography
and views. In 1917, two volumes of Marx&#8217;s and Engels&#8217;s works
appeared, containing their articles for 1852-62 (in German). This list of
Marx&#8217;s works must conclude with a note that many of Marx&#8217;s
shorter articles and letters, published, for the most part, in <em>Die
Neue Zeit</em>, <em>Vorw&#252;rts</em>, and other German-language Social-Democratic
periodicals, have not been enumerated. The list of Russian translations of
Marx is no doubt incomplete especially with reference to pamphlets that
appeared in 1905-06.</p><p>The literature on Marx and Marxism is very extensive. We shall mention
only what is most outstanding, and divide the authors into three main groups:
Marxists who, in important matters, adhere to Marx&#8217;s point of view;
bourgeois writers, in essence hostile to Marxism; and revisionists, who,
while claiming to accept certain fundamentals of Marxism, in fact replace it
with bourgeois conceptions. The Narodnik attitude towards Marx should be
considered a peculiarly Russian variety of revisionism. In his <em>Em

complete. More can be found in the indexes to <em>Die Neue Zeit</em>, 1883-1907,

doctrine, the following books are outstanding: Karl Kautsky, <em>The
Economic Doctrines of Karl Marx</em> (numerous editions in Russian), The
<em>Agrarian Question, The Erfurt Programme</em>, and numerous
pamphlets. Cf. also: <em>Eduard Bernstein, The Economic Doctrine of
Marx. The Third Volume of Capital</em> (Russian translation, 1905);
Gabriel Deville, <em>Capital</em> (an exposition of the first volume of
<em>Capital</em>, Russian translation, 1907). A representative of so-called
revisionism among Marxists, as regards the agrarian question, is Eduard
David, <em>Socialism and Agriculture</em> (Russian translation,
St. Petersburg, 1902). For a critique of revisionism see V. Ilyin, <em>The
Agrarian Question</em>, Part I, St. Petersburg, 1908. See also the following
books by V. Ilyin: <em>The Development of Capitalism in Russia</em>, second

development of Marx&#8217;s economic views as applied to recent phenomena in
economic life see Hilferding&#8217;s <em>Finance Capital</em> [in Russian],
St. Petersburg, 1911 (outstanding inaccuracies in the author&#8217;s views
on the theory of value have been corrected by Kautsky in &#8220;Gold, Papier

Highest Stage of Capitalism</em>, 1917. Pyotr Maslov in his <em>Agrarian
Question</em> (two volumes) and <em>The Theory of Economic Development</em>,
St. Petersburg, 1910, deviates from Marxism on important points. A

<em>Collection of Political Science</em>, St. Petersburg, 1888, and
<em>The History of Political Doctrines</em>, Part 5, Moscow, 1902, 156

Mr. Chicherin&#8217;s Glasses,&#8221; in his <em>Collected Works</em>,
Vol. II, St. Petersburg, 1900; L. Slonimsky, <em>The Economic
Doctrine of Karl Marx</em>, St. Petersburg, 1898; N. Zieber,
<em>David Ricardo and Karl Marx in Their Socioeconomic
Investigations</em>, St. Petersburg, 1885, and his <em>Collected Works</em>,
in two volumes, St. Petersburg, 1900. Also J. Kaufmann&#8217;s (J. K-n)
review of <em>Capital</em> in <em>Vesinik Yevropy</em> for 1872, No. 5&#8212;an
article marked by the fact that, in his addendum to the second edition of
<em>Capital</em>, Marx quoted J. K-n&#8217;s arguments, recognising them as
a correct exposition of his dialectical-materialist method.</p><p>The Russian Narodniks on Marxism: N. K. Mikhailovskyin <em>Russcoye
Bogatstvo</em>, 1894, No. 10, and 1895, Nos. 1 and 2; also reprinted in his
<em>Collected Works</em>&#8212;remarks on P. Struve&#8217;s <em>Critical
Notes</em> (St. Petersburg, 1894). Mikhailovsky&#8217;s views were analysed
from a Marxist point of view by K. Tulin (V. Ilyin) in his <em>Data
Characterising Our Economic Development</em> (St. Petersburg, 1895,
destroyed by the censor), later reprinted in V. Ilyin&#8217;s <em>For Twelve
Years</em>, St. Petersburg, 1908. Other Narodnik works: V. V., <em>Our Lines
of Policy</em>, St. Petersburg, 1892, and <em>From the Seventies to the
Twentieth Century</em>, St. Petersburg, 1907; Nikolai-on, <em>Outline of Our
Post-Reform Social Economy</em>, St. Petersburg, 1893; V. Chernov,
<em>Marxism and the Agrarian Problem</em>, St. Petersburg, 1906,

Sociological Foundations of Marxism</em> [in Russian], Moscow, 1900; Croce,
<em>Historical Materialism and Marxian Economy</em> [in Russian],
St. Petersburg, 1902.</p><p>For a correct appraisal of Marx&#8217;s views, an acquaintance is
essential with the works of Frederick Engels, his closest fellow-thinker and
collaborator. It is impossible to understand Marxism and to propound it
fully without taking into account all the works of Engels.</p><p>For a critique of Marx from the point of view of anarchism, see
