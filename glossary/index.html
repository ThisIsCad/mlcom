The Bourgeoisie is the social class of the modern capitalists, people that own the means of production (the tools, buildings, and raw resources used to produce commodities) and employ wage laborers. The bourgeois make their money by extracting surplus value from their workers in the form of profits.</li><li><a name=Capitalism href=#Capitalism>Capitalism</a>
Capitalism is a socio-economic system where private individuals (Capitalists) own and privately control the factories, farms, large businesses - the means of production. Workers (wage laborers) have very little to no input at all about the choices of what, where and how things are done in the company.</li><li><a name=Communism href=#Communism>Communism</a>
Communism is a stateless, moneyless, classless (equal) society where people’s needs and desires are met in full following the motto
&ldquo;to each according to their need, to each according to their ability&rdquo;. This is the socio-economic stage that comes after socialism.</li><li><a name=ML href=#ML>ML</a>
ML is an abbreviation for Marxist-Leninist, individuals who follow the political theory/ideology synthesized by Stalin. They use Dialectical and Historical Materialism to analyze society scientifically, and believe in the need for a Vanguard Party of the proletariat, comprised of individuals well educated on theory, in order to foster the necessary class consciousness to overthrow capitalism.</li><li><a name=MLM href=#MLM>MLM/Maoists</a>
MLMs/Maoists refers to the synthesis of work by Gonzalo, who is widely denounced outside of Maoist circles for the terrible things that he committed during his rule, such as the Lucanamarca Massacre that he openly took credit for. MLMs also tend to denounce modern China and other Already Existing Socialist countries as &ldquo;not socialist enough&rdquo;. MLMs are often criticized as allowing oneself to call themselves a marxist, while being anti-communist and idealist.</li><li><a name=Proletariat href=#Proletariat>Proletariat</a>
The Proletariat is the social class of people that sell their personal labor power in exchange for a wage. They are often referred to as the working class. Their are quantitative differences between members of the proletarian, e.g. how much money they earn, but they are united by the need to sell their labor power for a wage.</li><li><a name=Socialism href=#Socialism>Socialism</a>
Socialism is a socio-economic system where the working class (the proletariat) own and democratically control the factories, farms, large businesses - the means of production. The state is a dicatorship of the proletariat, with the capitalists (bourgeois) having no or minimal influence. The motto of socialism is &ldquo;To each according to their work, to each according to their ability&rdquo;. Socialism is a spectrum, representing the transition from capitalism to communism, likely over a long period of time.</li><li><a name=Ultra href=#Ultra>Ultra</a>
Ultra, short for &ldquo;ultra-left&rdquo;, is a loose slang term for those leftists that might be called puritans, they ignore material conditions and often denounce existing socialist countries, call for immediate revolution regardless of the material conditions, etc. They typically refuse to adapt to modern times and accept that the raw theory of Stalin/Mao/Whomever can&rsquo;t just be uncritically applied to wherever in the 21st century.</li></ul></article></div></section><section id=sidebar>This glossary should serve as a high-level description of Leftist terminology, not an in-depth explanation of each term.<br><br>Readers should be aware that this is an explicitly Marxist-Leninist glossary, so not all terms will be represented neutrally or favorably.<br><br>Many of these terms represent complex ideologies or theories and should be researched further to get the best understanding.<hr style="margin:2rem 0"><p><a href=https://github.com/ThisIsCad/mlcom/blob/master/content/glossary/index.md>Contribute To This Page<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" width="12" height="12" viewBox="0 0 32 32" class="fill-current v-base" aria-label="External Link"><path d="M25.152 16.576v5.696q0 2.144-1.504 3.648T20 27.424H5.152q-2.144.0-3.648-1.504T0 22.272V7.424q0-2.112 1.504-3.616t3.648-1.536h12.576q.224.0.384.16t.16.416V4q0 .256-.16.416t-.384.16H5.152q-1.184.0-2.016.832t-.864 2.016v14.848q0 1.184.864 2.016t2.016.864H20q1.184.0 2.016-.864t.832-2.016v-5.696q0-.256.16-.416t.416-.16h1.152q.256.0.416.16t.16.416zM32 1.152v9.12q0 .48-.352.8t-.8.352-.8-.352l-3.136-3.136-11.648 11.648q-.16.192-.416.192t-.384-.192l-2.048-2.048q-.192-.16-.192-.384t.192-.416L24.064 5.088l-3.136-3.136q-.352-.352-.352-.8t.352-.8.8-.352h9.12q.48.0.8.352t.352.8z"/></svg></a></p></section></main><footer class=footer><div class="center mw9 flex-ns flex-wrap items-center justify-start"><p>This is a community maintained and operated website for Marxist-Leninists.</p></div></footer><script>var main_menu=document.getElementById("main-menu"),main_menu_visible=!1;document.getElementById("hamburger-menu").addEventListener("click",e=>{e.preventDefault(),main_menu_visible?(main_menu_visible=!1,main_menu.classList=["collapsed"]):(main_menu_visible=!0,main_menu.classList=["visible"])})</script></body></html>
