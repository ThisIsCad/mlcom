It is modeled after the open source community in this way. We hope to make the website easy to contribute to, by individuals of all backgrounds, ethnicities, nationalities, etc, but this will be an ongoing process.</p><p>The website itself is housed on GitHub.com, a popular software repository owned by Microsoft. However, it may be moved to an alternative platform in the future, if we ever encounter issues being hosted there. GitHub was picked for its ease of use and name recognition.</p><p>The website content itself is mostly in the form of <a href=https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/>Markdown files</a>. We highly recommend briefly familiarizing yourself with Markdown if you wish to start contributing, although the syntax is fairly intuitive once you get started. The rest of the website (such as the layout and design) is templated HTML and SASS. We use the Hugo static site generator to compile everything into a light-weight static website.</p><p>The reason for using Hugo over a content management system, such as WordPress, is to allow us to easily incorporate standard open-source workflow processes such as content-review and approvals. This is not to gatekeep editing, but to ensure content on this website is well-vetted by the ML community, and to ensure this website remains a Marxist-Leninist platform. There are many other platforms available for non-MLs.</p><h2 id=how-to-contribute>How to contribute</h2><ol><li>Visit GitHub.com and sign-in or create an account</li><li>Navigate to the GitHub project (github.com/thisiscad/mlcom)</li><li>More instructions to follow!</li></ol></article></div></section></main><footer class=footer><div class="center mw9 flex-ns flex-wrap items-center justify-start"><p>This is a community maintained and operated website for Marxist-Leninists.</p></div></footer><script></script></body></html>
