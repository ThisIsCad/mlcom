    <p>
In this groundbreaking book, Arnold August explores Cuba’s unique form of democracy, presenting a detailed and balanced analysis of Cuba’s electoral process and the state’s functioning between elections. By comparing it with practices in the U.S., Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador, August shows that people’s participation in politics and society is not limited to a singular U.S.-centric understanding of democracy. For example, democracy as practised in the U.S. is largely non-participatory, static and fixed in time.<br><br>

Cuba, by contrast, is a laboratory where the process of democratization is continually in motion, an ongoing experiment to create new ways for people to participate. August argues forcefully for the need to develop mutual understanding of different political systems and, in doing so, to not be satisfied with either blanket condemnation or idealistic illusions, both resulting from a refusal to analyze the actual inner workings of each process.

    <p>This is a short 10 minute primer on the Cuban democratic system by azureScapegoat. It's a common myth that Cuban is a authoritarian dictatorship, but in reality, it has a vibrant system of participatory democracy. The Cuban constitution is the result of input from millions of Cuban citizens, the majority of the adult population of Cuba at the time. The vote to accept the constitution had a voter turnout of 98% with widespread support. </p>
