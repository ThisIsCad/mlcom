    <p>This article presents a case for why China is socialist, and how it has benefitted from national planning. It concludes that China succeeded in its economic development because the socialist sector has so far controlled and led domestic capitalism and foreign investment within the framework of planned national economic goals.</p>

    <p>A collection of resources about Xinjiang and the false accusations of a genocide against the Uyghur population. The propaganda about a Uyghur genocide was perpertuated by western imperialist forces as part of their ongoing fight against China. Xinjiang is a resource rich area and the US knows this, and wants access to it.</p>

      This study tackles four Western Marxist misrepresentations of
       socialism with Chinese characteristics, particularly as it has  
       developed with the reform and opening-up. Each of these 
       misrepresentations sets in opposition the economy and the state,
       with the former being seen as “capitalist” (in some form) and the 
       latter as variously “authoritarian,” “bureaucratic” or simply as 
       “interventionist.” In other words, “Chinese characteristics” 
       designates the superstructural feature that determines— 
       incorrectly in light of Marxist analysis—the economic base, which 
       is mistakenly seen as capitalist. While each misrepresentation has 
       its own distinct problems, they also have common problems: a 
       voluntarist position on political decisions, which fails to provide
       any reason for a “capitalist turn”; the assumption that a “market
       economy,” wherever and whenever it appears, is by definition 
       capitalist; the deployment of neocolonial and “Orientalist”
       assumptions coupled with a Western “betrayal narrative’; and a
       systemic neglect of Chinese language research. The conclusion 
       provides a summarising assessment that focuses on the empirical 
       flaws and methodological presuppositions of these
       misrepresentations. We emphasise that our focus is primarily on
       the internal problems and_ inconsistencies of these 
       misrepresentations, although we also offer—where needed— 
       some constructive alternatives.</p>

    <p>The overwhelming majority of people living in China say they are living in a democracy. Most people in the United States say they do not. These findings are part of a new study published by the Denmark-based Alliance of Democracies Foundation and Germany-based Latana data tracking firm. Part of the latest installment of the annual Democracy Perception Index published Monday, the study explores public opinions of democracy among 52,785 respondents across 53 nations and territories, including China and the U.S., surveyed between March 30 and May 10 of this year.</p>

    <a href="https://www.qiaocollective.com/education/tiananmenreadinglist">Tiananmen Protests Reading List <span class="badge">List</span></a>
    <p>More than thirty years later, the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 remain a touchstone of a Western mythology spun to challenge the fundamental legitimacy of the Communist Party of China. By collapsing the diverse and often contradictory demands of protesters into a simplistic call for Western-style capitalist democracy, the West’s selective memory of June 4 continues to inform liberal platitudes to “stand with the Chinese people” against their government, reifying the universality of Western capitalism and U.S. global hegemony in the process.<br><br>

This reading list compiles primary sources, Chinese state documents, and media fact-checking reports to challenge the hegemonic narrative of the Tiananmen protests. Far from the Western fairy-tale, these texts understand the June 4 tragedy in the context of the erosion of actually-existing socialism in the Soviet bloc, the contradictions of the reform and opening up period, antagonisms between student protesters, urban workers, and rural peasants, and the long challenge to China’s socialist past by “reformers” seeking to replicate the Western neoliberal model. </p>

    <p>China has brought over 700 million people out of poverty through economic development. But over 100 million people remained intractably poor, trapped in poverty due to isolation, low education, and infirmities. After gathering and organizing materials for half a year, the American-Chinese co-production team of "China's Poverty Alleviation at the Grassroots" immersed themselves into the local lives of China's rural poor in remote mountainous areas. With "targeted poverty alleviation" being the main topic, five simple but touching stories personalize the process and depict the measures of combating poverty.</p>
