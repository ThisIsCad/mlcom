    <p>The DPRK is continuously cast as a villain in international politics. The “hermit kingdom” is painted as tyrannical, repressive, and dynastic. In this essay, the author wants to argue the opposite: North Korea is a deeply democratic country, and this is reflective of its socialist values.</p>

From nuclear apocalypse and prison camps to banned sarcasm and compulsory identical haircuts - any shred of information regarding North Korea becomes a viral media hit, regardless of how dubious the story is.

    <p>Award-winning documentary filmmaker Sung-Hyung Cho was the first South Korean filmmaker to ever receive an official permit to film in North Korea. Traveling the country, she accompanies ordinary people during their everyday life and work routines, talking to them about their hopes and dreams. The resulting film ventures beyond the usual clichés and portrays the country and its people in a unique and respectful way.<br><br>Growing up in South Korea, Cho was taught in school that her Northern neighbors had red skin and two horns on their heads. With her film, she took the chance to bid farewell to her prejudices and revise her preconceived image of people in North Korea.</p>
