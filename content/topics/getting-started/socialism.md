  Here, we do our best to explain socialist, communist, and marxist ideas using plainer, beginner friendly language.<br><br>

  It is important to consider these topics are vast and complicated, and no short explanation can answer all of your questions. As always, the best solution for a comprehensive understanding is to read the theory behind it all.<br><br>

  There is no shortcut to reading theory yourself. Only by directly reading it, not the summarization created by others, can you ensure you have the complete picture.

**Socialism** is the transitionary stage between Capitalism, and Communism. Being a transitionary stage, it inherently spans a spectrum of characteristics, being closer towards Capitalism in the earlier stages, and getting progressively closer to Communism as time goes on. 

The single defining characteristic of Socialism is the inversion of the power dynamic between worker (*proletariat*) and capitalist (*bourgeois*). This is defined by Karl Marx as the Dictatorship of the Proletariat, however, *dictatorship* is being used differently then how you might be used to seeing. Marx describes the *state* as a dictatorship of the ruling *class*, with Capitalism having a Dictatorship of the Bourgeois, and Socialism having a Dictatorship of the Proletariat. This just means the state is run by a party of the working class, e.g. the Communist Party. 

The government is controlled by the working class, instead of the capitalist class. While capitalism is slowly dismantled, the party of the working class serve to keep the capitalists in check, and accountable to the workers. Unions and labor rights grow until they become universal, landlords are phased out and people can directly buy houses or receive public housing from the government. Healthcare and education become more accessible. 

These are the characteristics that Socialism would hold over time, but no two countries are likely to share the same path along Socialism. Exactly what it looks like, and how they progress along it will vary depending on the unique circumstances of each country. It is important to reserve your criticism of other socialist countries unless you deeply understand their unique conditions and what has lead them to make the decisions they have, as the people who live there, know best.
