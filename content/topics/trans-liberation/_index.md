description: The only path forward for trans liberation is the abolition of capitalism and the development of socialism. All socialists or aspiring socialists must endeavour to understand the struggles faced by trans individuals in today's society, so that we may all fight for their liberation and right to exist.

This topic contains a variety of resources and materials pertaining to Trans Liberation. The only path forward for trans liberation is the abolition of capitalism and the development of socialism. While it is clear that only the struggle for communism can lead to trans liberation, communists and socialists have often failed to adequately welcome and protect their trans comrades from internal reactionary forces who would attempt to continue to marginalize trans people within leftist organizations themselves. 

We must do better. The first step is educating yourself.

    <p>This is the first of three core videos about Caelan Conrad's time investigating the Gender Critical cult. Ideally, they should be watched in order. This first video covers how one gets recruited into the cult, and the tactics they use to keep you there. .</p>

    <p>This is the second of three core videos about Caelan Conrad's time investigating the Gender Critical cult.

    <p>This is the third of three core videos about Caelan Conrad's time investigating the Gender Critical cult. It reveals how Gender Critical activists intentionally manipulate the public, and exposes anti-trans activists and icons for who they are when they feel safe enough to drop the mask of persecution. It reveals their racism, homophobia, ableism and misogyny and serves as evidence that not only is the Gender Critical ideology a cult, but a hate group..</p>

    <p>What is a Groomer? From Salem to Stonewall, history repeats itself. As LGBTQ+ acceptance has grown worldwide, so has the reactionary forces who spread conspiracy theories that endanger the lives of many, and have proven difficult to quash. The "groomer" narrative has become so prevalent and pervasive that it needs to be met head-on before more people are hurt and killed.</p>

    <p>What is a Woman... truly a difficult question that only Matt Walsh was "brave" enough to ask. Yet, clearly, there are issues, so let's break down all the ways The Daily Wire plus' film What is a Woman manipulates its audience and how Matt Walsh created a documentary to frame trans people as the villains through misinformation. </p>

## Countering Popular Anti-Trans Celebrities

We've included this extensive section on JK Rowling not only because she's an influential figure, but because the views she expresses come straight from the TERF, aka "Gender Critical", transphobia movement. Hearing them get debunked gives us a good understanding of how to view the modern transphobic arguments we might come across
