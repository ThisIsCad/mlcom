## Why Do Fascists Want To Kill Trans Women?

In a nine-day period between June 25 and July 3, six Black trans women – Brayla Stone, Merci Mack, Shaki Peters, Draya McCarty, and Tatiana Hall – were found murdered. The news barely made a ripple; Black trans women and trans women of color are murdered regularly – and no one is shocked, because the gender class structure is operating as usual. Liberal-individualist analysis claims that this is simply the result of amorphous personal "prejudices" -- that individual men, fearful of the unknown or afraid of change, attack trans women for personal reasons.

This is both idealist and ahistorical, a comforting fantasy that naturalizes and atomizes the oppression of trans women as a class and protects the underlying gender class structure of the empire.

In fact, reactionaries make trans women a primary target. ICE imprisons trans women in special separate concentration camps under under even worse conditions than cisgender men and women, and during protests, police subject captured trans women for especially brutal treatment. On July 25, a group of pro-police protesters outside Pittsburgh switched their chant from "all lives matter" to "kill transgenders" and "kill faggots." State power and reactionary elements target trans women specifically – but why? Because the oppression of trans women as a class is critical to the gender class structure of the empire, and by centering the oppression of trans women in our material feminist analysis, we can understand that class structure much more clearly.

## What is the gender class structure of the empire?

Fundamentally, the gender class structure is built on the domination of white men over
women; white women constitute a subordinated but privileged class under the control
("protection") of white men, and reactionary white manhood is ultimately defined in
terms of control of women. 

## What is the role of trans women (and nonbinary transfeminine people, who are treated like trans women) in this gender class structure?

Trans women, nonbinary transfeminine people, and feminine gay cisgender men are
treated as a gender underclass. Structurally, they are "girls you can hit." They are also
subject to substantial sexual violence in the form of sexual assault and rape. Cisgender
women from oppressed and colonized nations are treated more like "girls you can hit" if
they are less acceptable as potential members of the "protected" class of potential
wives and mothers.

Thus, Black and Indigenous women are treated disposably as "girls you can hit." Likewise, sex workers, who are seen as disqualified from the "protected" class of women, are "girls you can hit." The further they are from the "protected" class of women, the
more disposable they are, and they are treated more and more like trans women. This
develops intersectionally as well; Black trans women are often accused of sex work to
justify violent treatment, and Black trans women sex workers are murdered casually

## Why do cisgender men oppress trans women? In other words, how do cisgender men benefit materially from oppressing trans women?

This dynamic arises in childhood, where they are an acceptable target for violence and
covert sex ("practice girls") by boys trying to enact their manhood. Men can gain status
and an identity as controllers of women by hurting "girls you can hit." They "protect"
(white, cis) women in the same way that the police "protect" communities: by enacting
violence on the underclass, they gain control over the "respectable" class of women.
The threat to the women they control is supposed to be implicit, not enacted: "Serve me
faithfully and you will never be hurt the way I hurt those sissies in middle school." But
the opposite side of the coin is that any "protected" woman who refuses to comply in a
serious and sustained way can be threatened with degradation to the underclass.
