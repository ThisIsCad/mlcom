socialism with Chinese characteristics, particularly as it has
developed with the reform and opening-up. Each of these
misrepresentations sets in opposition the economy and the state,
with the former being seen as “capitalist” (in some form) and the
latter as variously “authoritarian,” “bureaucratic” or simply as
“interventionist.” In other words, “Chinese characteristics”
designates the superstructural feature that determines—
incorrectly in light of Marxist analysis—the economic base, which
is mistakenly seen as capitalist. While each misrepresentation has
its own distinct problems, they also have common problems: a
voluntarist position on political decisions, which fails to provide
any reason for a “capitalist turn”; the assumption that a “market
economy,” wherever and whenever it appears, is by definition
capitalist; the deployment of neocolonial and “Orientalist”
assumptions coupled with a Western “betrayal narrative’; and a
systemic neglect of Chinese language research. The conclusion
provides a summarising assessment that focuses on the empirical
flaws and methodological presuppositions of these
misrepresentations. We emphasise that our focus is primarily on
the internal problems and_ inconsistencies of these
misrepresentations, although we also offer—where needed—
some constructive alternatives.</p></li><li><a href=https://www.qiaocollective.com/education/tiananmenreadinglist>Tiananmen Protests Reading List <span class=badge>List</span></a><p>More than thirty years later, the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 remain a touchstone of a Western mythology spun to challenge the fundamental legitimacy of the Communist Party of China. By collapsing the diverse and often contradictory demands of protesters into a simplistic call for Western-style capitalist democracy, the West’s selective memory of June 4 continues to inform liberal platitudes to “stand with the Chinese people” against their government, reifying the universality of Western capitalism and U.S. global hegemony in the process.<br><br><p>This reading list compiles primary sources, Chinese state documents, and media fact-checking reports to challenge the hegemonic narrative of the Tiananmen protests. Far from the Western fairy-tale, these texts understand the June 4 tragedy in the context of the erosion of actually-existing socialism in the Soviet bloc, the contradictions of the reform and opening up period, antagonisms between student protesters, urban workers, and rural peasants, and the long challenge to China’s socialist past by “reformers” seeking to replicate the Western neoliberal model.</p></p></li></ul><h2 id=curated-videos>Curated Videos</h2><ul class=curated-video-list><li><a class=logo href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuaJGPZCBYU"><img src=/maxresdefault_13192461989996739310_hue0be1df68f03c18dc21b07311a217694_0_168x94_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg></a>

But over 100 million people remained intractably poor, trapped in poverty due to isolation, low education, and infirmities. After gathering and organizing materials for half a year, the American-Chinese co-production team of "China's Poverty Alleviation at the Grassroots" immersed themselves into the local lives of China's rural poor in remote mountainous areas. With "targeted poverty alleviation" being the main topic, five simple but touching stories personalize the process and depict the measures of combating poverty.</p></li><li><a class=logo href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPA_hLdU4Jc"><img src=/xinjiang_hu3295c1f7a6a9f80caf9e0b893195cc64_398756_168x94_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg></a>

Gyude Moore is a visiting fellow at the Center for Global Development. He previously served as Liberia’s Minister of Public Works with oversight over the construction and maintenance of public infrastructure from December 2014 to January 2018. Prior to that role, Moore served as Deputy Chief of Staff to President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf and Head of the President’s Delivery Unit (PDU). As Head of the PDU, his team monitored progress and drove delivery of the Public Sector Investment Program of Liberia—a program of over $1 billion in road, power, port infrastructure, and social programs in Liberia after the civil war. As one of the President’s trusted advisors, he also played a crucial role in supporting President Sirleaf as Liberia responded to the West Africa Ebola outbreak and shaped its post-Ebola outlook. His research tracks the channels of private sources of finance, the rise of China and its expanding role in Africa, and Africa’s response to these changes. He holds a BS in Political Science from Berea College and an MS in Foreign Service from Georgetown University.</p></li></ul></article></div></section><section id=sidebar><p><a href=https://github.com/ThisIsCad/mlcom/blob/master/content/topics/china/_index.md>Contribute To This Page<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" width="12" height="12" viewBox="0 0 32 32" class="fill-current v-base" aria-label="External Link"><path d="M25.152 16.576v5.696q0 2.144-1.504 3.648T20 27.424H5.152q-2.144.0-3.648-1.504T0 22.272V7.424q0-2.112 1.504-3.616t3.648-1.536h12.576q.224.0.384.16t.16.416V4q0 .256-.16.416t-.384.16H5.152q-1.184.0-2.016.832t-.864 2.016v14.848q0 1.184.864 2.016t2.016.864H20q1.184.0 2.016-.864t.832-2.016v-5.696q0-.256.16-.416t.416-.16h1.152q.256.0.416.16t.16.416zM32 1.152v9.12q0 .48-.352.8t-.8.352-.8-.352l-3.136-3.136-11.648 11.648q-.16.192-.416.192t-.384-.192l-2.048-2.048q-.192-.16-.192-.384t.192-.416L24.064 5.088l-3.136-3.136q-.352-.352-.352-.8t.352-.8.8-.352h9.12q.48.0.8.352t.352.8z"/></svg></a></p></section></main><footer class=footer><div class="center mw9 flex-ns flex-wrap items-center justify-start"><p>This is a community maintained and operated website for Marxist-Leninists.</p></div></footer><script>var main_menu=document.getElementById("main-menu"),activeFootnote,main_menu_visible=!1;document.getElementById("hamburger-menu").addEventListener("click",e=>{e.preventDefault(),main_menu_visible?(main_menu_visible=!1,main_menu.classList=["collapsed"]):(main_menu_visible=!0,main_menu.classList=["visible"])}),document.getElementById("switch-style").addEventListener("change",e=>{e.target.checked?(document.getElementsByTagName("html")[0].classList.add("night"),document.cookie="colorMode=night; expires=Sun, 30 Dec 2029 12:00:00 UTC; path=/"):(document.getElementsByTagName("html")[0].classList.remove("night"),document.cookie="colorMode=light; expires=Sun, 30 Dec 2029 12:00:00 UTC; path=/")}),(document.cookie||"").includes("colorMode=night")&&(document.getElementById("switch-style").checked=!0,document.getElementsByTagName("html")[0].classList.add("night")),activeFootnote=null,window.onhashchange=function(){if(activeFootnote&&activeFootnote.classList.remove("highlight"),location.hash){var t=location.hash.substring(1);t.substring(0,4)==="note"&&(activeFootnote=document.querySelector('a[name="'+t+'"]').parentElement,activeFootnote&&activeFootnote.classList.add("highlight"))}},window.onhashchange(),document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){let e=document.querySelector(".loading");e.classList.remove("loading")})</script></body></html>
