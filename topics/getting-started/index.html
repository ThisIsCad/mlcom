You have probably heard these terms, but many people don&rsquo;t have a concrete understanding of what they mean. Socialism isn&rsquo;t simply when the government provides social safety nets or benefits, and communism isn&rsquo;t about taking all of your stuff away. Socialism has significantly improved the lives of many people across the world, uplifted millions out of poverty, and lead to a higher standard of living.</p><p>Before we can understand socialism and communism, we must first understand Capitalism.</p><p><strong>Capitalism</strong> is the socio-economic system, based on private ownership of the <em>means of production</em> (factories, tools, machines, vehicles, land, and raw materials used to build products), and exploitation of workers, by means of extracting <em>surplus value</em> (the value that workers generate, but are not paid - known as <em>profit</em>). Capitalists earn their money by extracting surplus value from workers, while workers earn money by selling their labor to capitalists.</p><p>This is an inherently coercive relationship. Many argue that you can just quit, or find another job, but any system where people <strong>must</strong> work or they do not receive housing, food, and other basic necessities, is a coercive system. Your boss <em>always</em> has the power to arbitrarily fire you. Your landlord can evict you at any time. You may not be in a position to find a better job, so you must accept whatever working conditions are forced upon you.</p><p>The government under capitalism was created by capitalists, and exists to keep the working class in this exploitive relationship and to maintain the monopoly over the means of production. This is why you rarely see labor reform from &ldquo;liberals&rdquo; or &ldquo;conservatives&rdquo;, as both parties serve the interest of capital. Any reforms are temporary, offering the bare minimum to quell civil unrest. Most government representatives are closely tied to private enterprise, via the stock market, friends, family, or cushy jobs waiting for them after they leave the government. It is against their material interests to pass labor reform that would benefit the majority of the voting population, because they wouldn&rsquo;t receive as many personal benefits.</p><p><a href=socialism/><strong>Socialism</strong></a> is the transitionary stage between Capitalism, and Communism. The power dynamic between worker and capitalist is inverted. The workers own the <em>means of production</em> (factories, tools, machines, vehicles, land, and raw materials used to build products). Key industries are <em>nationalized</em>, taxes on the ultra-rich capitalist class are increased, and wealth re-distribution starts to occur.</p><p>The government is controlled by the working class, instead of the capitalist class. While capitalism is slowly dismantled, the party of the working class serve to keep the capitalists in check, and accountable to the workers. Unions and labor rights become universal, landlords are phased out and people can directly buy houses or receive public housing from the government.</p><p><strong>Communism</strong> is the stage after socialism, once capitalism has been abolished entirely. The power dynamic between worker and capitalist no longer exist, as there are no longer separate <em>classes</em>. The tools that have previously served to oppress the working class or capitalist class are no longer necessary, and wither away.</p><p>People live in relative abundance, as planned economies allow us to avoid resource waste, and ensure food and other goods are delivered to where they are needed. All of society benefits from improvements such as automation, which allow shorter working weeks for all.</p><p><strong>Marxism</strong> is both political theory and a framework with which to analyze the world. We use marxism to understand <em>class struggle</em> (the struggle and contradiction between worker and capitalist), and how our political systems can be viewed through this lens (including historically). Marxism is the scientific study and analysis of society using <em>dialectical materialism</em> (a term that will be explained in some of our recommended reading or recommended videos).</p><h2 id=reading-list>Reading List</h2><ul class=taxonomy-list><li><a href=/posts/solidaritypost/idealism-vs-materialism/>Idealism vs Materialism</a><p>All philosophies created since the advent of class society have fallen into one of two main camps: idealism or materialism.
