You have probably heard these terms, but many people don&rsquo;t have a concrete understanding of what they mean. Socialism isn&rsquo;t simply when the government provides social safety nets or benefits, and communism isn&rsquo;t about taking all of your stuff away. Socialism has significantly improved the lives of many people across the world, uplifted millions out of poverty, and lead to a higher standard of living.</p><p>Before we can understand socialism and communism, we must first understand Capitalism.</p><hr class=small><h2 id=capitalism>Capitalism</h2><p><strong>Capitalism</strong> is the socio-economic system, based on private ownership of the <em>means of production</em> (factories, tools, machines, vehicles, land, and raw materials used to build products), and exploitation of workers, by means of extracting <em>surplus value</em> (the value that workers generate, but are not paid - known as <em>profit</em>). Capitalists earn their money by extracting surplus value from workers, while workers earn money by selling their labor to capitalists.</p><p>This is an inherently coercive relationship. Many argue that you can just quit, or find another job, but any system where people <strong>must</strong> work or they do not receive housing, food, and other basic necessities, is a coercive system. Your boss <em>always</em> has the power to arbitrarily fire you. Your landlord can evict you at any time. You may not be in a position to find a better job, so you must accept whatever working conditions are forced upon you.</p><p>The government under capitalism was created by capitalists, and exists to keep the working class in this exploitive relationship and to maintain the monopoly over the means of production. This is why you rarely see labor reform from &ldquo;liberals&rdquo; or &ldquo;conservatives&rdquo;, as both parties serve the interest of capital. Any reforms are temporary, offering the bare minimum to quell civil unrest. Most government representatives are closely tied to private enterprise, via the stock market, friends, family, or cushy jobs waiting for them after they leave the government. It is against their material interests to pass labor reform that would benefit the majority of the voting population, because they wouldn&rsquo;t receive as many personal benefits.</p><hr class=small><h2 id=socialism>Socialism</h2><p><strong>Socialism</strong> is the transitionary stage between Capitalism, and Communism. Being a transitionary stage, it inherently spans a spectrum of characteristics, being closer towards Capitalism in the earlier stages, and getting progressively closer to Communism as time goes on.</p><p>The single defining characteristic of Socialism is the inversion of the power dynamic between worker (<em>proletariat</em>) and capitalist (<em>bourgeois</em>). This is defined by Karl Marx as the Dictatorship of the Proletariat, however, <em>dictatorship</em> is being used differently then how you might be used to seeing. Marx describes the <em>state</em> as a dictatorship of the ruling <em>class</em>, with Capitalism having a Dictatorship of the Bourgeois, and Socialism having a Dictatorship of the Proletariat. This just means the state is run by a party of the working class, e.g. the Communist Party. While no capitalist parties are allowed, socialist governments are still highly democratic. See <a href=/topics/getting-started/socialist-democracy/>Socialist Democracy</a> for more information.</p><p>The government is controlled by the working class, instead of the capitalist class. While capitalism is slowly dismantled, the party of the working class serve to keep the capitalists in check, and accountable to the workers. Unions and labor rights grow until they become universal, landlords are phased out and people can directly buy houses or receive public housing from the government. Healthcare and education become more accessible.</p><p>These are the characteristics that Socialism would hold over time, but no two countries are likely to share the same path along Socialism. Exactly what it looks like, and how they progress along it will vary depending on the unique circumstances of each country. It is important to reserve your criticism of other socialist countries unless you deeply understand their unique conditions and what has lead them to make the decisions they have, as the people who live there, know best.</p><hr class=small><h2 id=communism>Communism</h2><p><strong>Communism</strong> is the stage after socialism, once capitalism has been abolished entirely. The power dynamic between worker and capitalist no longer exist, as there are no longer separate <em>classes</em>. The tools that have previously served to oppress the working class or capitalist class are no longer necessary, and wither away. The government will likely still exist, and will continue to be an instrument of democracy. See <a href=/topics/getting-started/socialist-democracy/>Socialist Democracy</a> for more information.</p><p>People live in relative abundance, as planned economies allow us to avoid resource waste, and ensure food and other goods are delivered to where they are needed. All of society benefits from improvements such as automation, which allow shorter working weeks for all.</p><p>Precise details about what communism will look like are hard to determine, because it is a long term plan that will be shaped by the technology and circumstances at the time. Is is a goal to work towards in the long term, but not something we will accomplish overnight. Communism isn&rsquo;t the endpoint either, just a new beginning point for further change. Principled communists believe in the continued progress of society, not stagnation. We reject the notion of an &ldquo;end to history&rdquo;, as society is never static and is always changing.</p><p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that while <em>private property</em> will be abolished entirely, this refers to private ownership over the <em>means of production</em> (factories, workshops, tools, farms, raw resources, etc), <em>not</em> the ownership of personal property (such as a home, toothbrush, bicycle, etc). Items you use for yourself, not to produce goods or services for others.</p><hr class=small><h2 id=marxism>Marxism</h2><p><strong>Marxism</strong> is both political theory and a framework with which to analyze the world. We use marxism to understand <em>class struggle</em> (the struggle and contradiction between worker and capitalist), and how our political systems can be viewed through this lens (including historically). Marxism is the scientific study and analysis of society using <em>dialectical materialism</em> (a term that will be explained in some of our recommended reading or recommended videos).</p><ul class=taxonomy-list></ul></article></div></section><section id=sidebar><p id=sidebar-text><strong>Community Note:</strong><br><br>Here, we do our best to explain socialist, communist, and marxist ideas using plainer, beginner friendly language.<br><br>It is important to consider these topics are vast and complicated, and no short explanation can answer all of your questions.
