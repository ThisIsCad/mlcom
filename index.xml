yet been published. More works by Marx have been translated into
Russian than into any other language. The following list of
Marx&amp;#8217;s writings is arranged in chronological order. In 1841 Marx wrote
his thesis on Epicurus&amp;#8217;s philosophy. (It was included in
Literarischer Nachiass, of which more will be said later.) In this
thesis, Marx still fully adhered to the Hegelian idealist point of view.</description></item><item><title>Chapter I.

There is an excellent YouTube series by Dissident Theory called Understanding Marx's Capital Volumes 1-3, that does a good job at explaining the book section by section.
Section 1 THE TWO FACTORS OF A COMMODITY: USE-VALUE AND VALUE (THE SUBSTANCE OF VALUE AND THE MAGNITUDE OF VALUE) The wealth of those societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails, presents itself as “an immense accumulation of commodities,”[1] its unit being a single commodity.</description></item><item><title>Contribute</title><link>/contribute/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/contribute/</guid><description>This website was designed to be built and maintained by the Marxist-Leninist community, not by any organization or individual.

It is called dialectical materialism because its approach to the phenomena of nature, its method of studying and apprehending them, is dialectical, while its interpretation of the phenomena of nature, its conception of these phenomena, its theory, is materialistic.
Historical materialism is the extension of the principles of dialectical materialism to the study of social life, an application of the principles of dialectical materialism to the phenomena of the life of society, to the study of society and of its history.</description></item><item><title>Girls You Can Hit</title><link>/topics/trans-liberation/girls-you-can-hit/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/topics/trans-liberation/girls-you-can-hit/</guid><description>Why Do Fascists Want To Kill Trans Women? In a nine-day period between June 25 and July 3, six Black trans women – Brayla Stone, Merci Mack, Shaki Peters, Draya McCarty, and Tatiana Hall – were found murdered. The news barely made a ripple; Black trans women and trans women of color are murdered regularly – and no one is shocked, because the gender class structure is operating as usual. Liberal-individualist analysis claims that this is simply the result of amaorphous personal &amp;ldquo;prejudices&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; that individual men, fearful of the unknown or afraid of change, attack trans women for personal reasons.</description></item><item><title>Glossary</title><link>/glossary/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/glossary/</guid><description>Bourgeoisie The Bourgeoisie is the social class of the modern capitalists, people that own the means of production (the tools, buildings, and raw resources used to produce commodities) and employ wage laborers.

His father was a lawyer, a Jew, who in 1824 adopted Protestantism. The family was well-to-do, cultured, but not revolutionary. After graduating from a Gymnasium in Trier, Marx entered the university, first at Bonn and later in Berlin, where he read law, majoring in history and philosophy. He concluded his university course in 1841, submitting a doctoral thesis on the philosophy of Epicurus.</description></item><item><title>Marx’s Economic Doctrine</title><link>/archives/lenin/works/1914/karl-marx/marxs-economic-doctrine/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/lenin/works/1914/karl-marx/marxs-economic-doctrine/</guid><description>“It is the ultimate aim of this work to lay bare the economic law of motion of modern society, i.e., capitalist, bourgeois society,”
says Marx in the preface to Capital. An investigation into the relations of production in a given, historically defined society, in their inception, development, and decline—such is the content of Marx’s economic doctrine. In capitalist society, the production of commodities is predominant, and Marx’s analysis therefore begins with an analysis of commodity.</description></item><item><title>Oppose Book Worship</title><link>/archives/mao/selected-works/volume-6/oppose-book-worship/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/mao/selected-works/volume-6/oppose-book-worship/</guid><description>I. NO INVESTIGATION, NO RIGHT TO SPEAK Unless you have investigated a problem, you will be deprived of the right to speak on it. Isn&amp;rsquo;t that too harsh? Not in the least. When you have not probed into a problem, into the present facts and its past history, and know nothing of its essentials, whatever you say about it will undoubtedly be nonsense. Talking nonsense solves no problems, as everyone knows, so why is it unjust to deprive you of the right to speak?</description></item><item><title>Preamble</title><link>/archives/marx/1848-communist-manifesto/preamble/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/marx/1848-communist-manifesto/preamble/</guid><description>A spectre is haunting Europe — the spectre of communism. All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: Pope and Tsar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German police-spies.
Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as communistic by its opponents in power? Where is the opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of communism, against the more advanced opposition parties, as well as against its reactionary adversaries?</description></item><item><title>Preface</title><link>/archives/lenin/works/1914/karl-marx/preface/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/lenin/works/1914/karl-marx/preface/</guid><description>This article on Karl Marx, which now appears in a separate printing, was written in 1913 (as far as I can remember) for the Granat Encyclopaedia. A fairly detailed bibliography of literature on Marx, mostly foreign, was appended to the article. This has been omitted in the present edition. The editor of the Encyclopaedia, for their part, have, for censorship reasons, deleted the end of the article on Marx, namely, the section dealing with his revolutionary tactics.</description></item><item><title>Preface</title><link>/archives/marx/1848-communist-manifesto/preface/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/marx/1848-communist-manifesto/preface/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Socialism</title><link>/archives/lenin/works/1914/karl-marx/socialism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/lenin/works/1914/karl-marx/socialism/</guid><description>From the foregoing, it is evident that Marx deduces the inevitability of the transformation of capitalist society into socialist society and wholly and exclusively from the economic law of the development of contemporary society. The socialization of labor, which is advancing ever more rapidly in thousands of forms and has manifested itself very strikingly, during the half-century since the death of Marx, in the growth of large-scale production, capitalist cartels, syndicates and trusts, as well as in the gigantic increase in the dimensions and power of finance capital, provides the principal material foundation for the inevitable advent of socialism.</description></item><item><title>Tactics of the Class Struggle of the Proletariat</title><link>/archives/lenin/works/1914/karl-marx/tactics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/lenin/works/1914/karl-marx/tactics/</guid><description>After examining, as early as 1844-45, one of the main shortcomings in the earlier materialism—namely, its inability to understand the conditions or appreciate the importance of practical revolutionary activity—Marx, along with his theoretical work, devoted unremitting attention, throughout his lifetime, to the tactical problems of the proletariat’s class struggle. An immense amount of material bearing on this is contained in all the works of Marx, particularly in the four volumes of his correspondence with Engels, published in 1913.</description></item><item><title>The Marxist Doctrine</title><link>/archives/lenin/works/1914/karl-marx/the-marxist-doctrine/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/lenin/works/1914/karl-marx/the-marxist-doctrine/</guid><description>Marxism is the system of Marx’s views and teachings. Marx was the genius who continued and consummated the three main ideological currents of the 19th century, as represented by the three most advanced countries of mankind: classical German philosophy, classical English political economy, and French socialism combined with French revolutionary doctrines in general. Acknowledged even by his opponents, the remarkable consistency and integrity of Marx’s views, whose totality constitutes modern materialism and modern scientific socialism, as the theory and programme of the working-class movement in all the civilized countries of the world, make it incumbent on us to present a brief outline of his world-conception in general, prior to giving an exposition of the principal content of Marxism, namely, Marx’s economic doctrine.</description></item><item><title>The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism</title><link>/archives/lenin/works/1913/three-sources-and-three-component-parts-of-marxism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/archives/lenin/works/1913/three-sources-and-three-component-parts-of-marxism/</guid><description>This article was published in 1913 in Prosveshcheniye No. 3, dedicated to the Thirtieth Anniversary of Marx’s death.
Prosveshcheniye (Enlightenment) was a Bolshevik social, political and literary monthly published legally in St. Petersburg from December 1911 onwards. Its inauguration was proposed by Lenin to replace the Bolshevik journal Mysl (Thought), a Moscow publication banned by the tsarist government. Lenin directed the work of the journal from abroad and wrote the following articles for it: “Fundamental Problems of the Election Campaign”, “Results of the Election”, “Critical Remarks on the National Question”, “The Right of Nations to Self-Determination”, and others.</description></item></channel></rss>
